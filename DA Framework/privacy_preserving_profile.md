# Privacy-Preserving Profile for Delegated Authorization

**Working draft v1.2 — Companion Profile to the Delegated Authorization Reference Architecture v4.2**

*A layered profile that makes minimum-disclosure of delegation structure binding, for deployments involving vulnerable populations or sensitive relationship types.*

*This file replaces the prior `privacy_preserving_profile_v1.0.md`. Per `CLAUDE.md` §4.7 the version is carried in this header and the changelog below; the filename is stable across revisions.*

**Changelog (v1.1 → v1.2):**
- **New §3.6 — Placement of a Policy Decision Point.** Base spec §11.7.1 (new in v4.2) proposes resolving governing instruments a verifier was not handed by retrieving them at decision time through a PIP attached to a Permissioned Capabilities PDP. Under this profile that retrieval is itself a **disclosure channel** — through its response, and through the *pattern* of queries even where each response is a bare boolean, since in the populations this profile protects the affirmative case is the minority. §3.6 states that a PDP performing or observing such retrieval MUST reside within the intermediary's trust domain and never within a relying party's; that where a relying party's PDP would need the input, the intermediary performs the retrieval and evaluation and conveys only the decision (the resolution §6.9 already applies to admitted-type gating and §6.2 to group membership); that no denial reason may distinguish an instrument-driven refusal from an ordinary one; and that "none — bounded by lifetime" is unavailable as a status mechanism for the sources involved.
- **Records the consequence for the intermediary's role.** §3.3 describes an issuing and flattening party; a deployment adopting this pattern makes the intermediary additionally a **decision-time actor**, which is a larger operational and regulatory commitment than §3.2 contemplates and should be declared in the conformance statement. The section states the condition, and does not require the pattern.
- **Re-based to Reference Architecture v4.2** (header and reference list). v4.1 and v4.2 changed only open questions and references, so no substantive re-base review was required.
- **Version:** additive — one new sub-section constraining a pattern the base specification newly describes; no existing requirement changed, and no previously-conformant deployment is made non-conformant → **minor** bump (v1.2).

**Changelog (v1.0 → v1.1):**
- **Re-based from Reference Architecture v1.1 to v4.0.** v1.0 was written against the four-component base and had fallen three major revisions behind. This revision aligns it; the profile's own architecture (the intermediary, R1–R6, the two-token split) is unchanged.
- **New §6.8 — Objective and Beneficiary Non-Disclosure (normative).** The **Objective** (base spec §9), added at RA v2.0, had no treatment in this profile at all. It carries `action`, the structured `purpose` object, and an **optional `beneficiary`** — and in this profile's deployments the beneficiary *is* the protected person. §6.8 makes the Objective intermediary-held and forbids the beneficiary from reaching a relying party in any form.
- **New §2.5 — Conformance level floor (L2).** RA v4.0 §3.2 introduced conformance levels; this profile's verification intermediary is a distinct issuing role by construction, so its authorship is distributed by definition and its floor is **L2**. The compact (L0) packaging is structurally unavailable here, and stating so prevents a deployment from claiming this profile over a self-issued single JWT.
- **New §6.9 — Admitted-Type Enumeration.** RA v2.4/v3.0 moved the enforceable "within authority" test off `scope_domain` (now advisory) and onto an enumeration of admitted RAR types (§5.5.1). That relocated the disclosure surface this profile's §6.1 was built to cover: abstracting `scope_domain` is now cheap and no longer sufficient on its own, because the type enumeration is what carries the enforceable meaning.
- **§6.6 aligned to the new §8.3.1 status-mechanism menu**, and this profile's mechanism stated: **"none — bounded by lifetime" is not available** to a conformant deployment.
- **§6.7 terminology corrected for RA v3.0.** It referred to the intermediary emitting "the currently-active scope" from a stage schedule; `scope_override` was removed at v3.0 and Relationship-side stages now carry a descriptive `capacity_band`, never scope. Reworded.
- **§5.1 and §5.2 re-anchored:** the rich credential set now names the Objective, and the presentation token's `purpose` is anchored to the Objective's purpose object (§9.4), which relocated from Obligations at RA v2.5.
- **§1.1 and §11.1** corrected from "four-component" and "v1.1" to the current five-component v4.0 base.
- **Version:** additive — new normative constraints and a stated floor; no existing requirement removed or weakened → **minor** bump (v1.1).

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Why This Profile Exists

The base Reference Architecture defines a clean five-component model for delegated authorization (Relationship, Authority, the inert Objective, Obligations, and Constraints). For most deployments — agentic AI delegation, corporate signing authority, healthcare credentialing among professional peers — the base specification is sufficient.

For deployments where the delegatee population includes **vulnerable individuals** or where the **type of delegation is itself sensitive**, the base specification is necessary but not sufficient. A platform receiving a base-specification credential could observe enough of its structure to infer information that the delegation system was meant to protect: the cardinality of a guardian's responsibilities, the legal basis for their authority, their professional role, or the membership pattern of authorized groups.

This profile addresses that gap. It does so by **layering** privacy requirements on top of the base specification rather than modifying the base specification's credentials or claims. Implementers conform to the base spec to interoperate with the broader ecosystem; deployments that handle vulnerable populations additionally conform to this profile.

### 1.2 Design Principle: Layering, Not Replacement

This profile changes nothing in the base specification's wire format, claim definitions, or binding model. Authority JWTs, Relationship JWTs, and Task JWTs as defined in the Reference Architecture are issued, bound, and validated identically. What this profile changes is:

1. **Who issues the credentials that platforms see.** Under this profile, platforms do not see the raw credentials defined in the base specification. They see *presentation credentials* derived from those raw credentials by a regulated verification intermediary.
2. **What fields appear in the platform-facing presentation.** The presentation is constrained to a narrow, abstract set of attributes that does not allow the relying party to reconstruct the underlying delegation structure.
3. **How revocation, transfer, and audit are routed.** The intermediary handles all platform-facing lifecycle events, so platforms never observe the underlying state changes that would otherwise leak context.

The base-specification credentials continue to exist and to do their job — they live inside the intermediary, where they support audit, dispute resolution, and oversight. They simply do not cross the relying-party boundary.

### 1.3 Relationship to the Stress Test Findings

The six privacy requirements R1–R6 in §4 of this profile are drawn directly from the *OIDF Delegated Authority Policy Framework for Child Rights-Respecting Digital Environments* (O'Connell & Curtis, April 2026), §4.2 of that document. The framework identified these as binding architectural requirements for any deployment involving children. This profile generalizes them to apply to any deployment involving vulnerable populations and adopts them as MUSTs for conforming implementations.

---

## 2. Scope and Applicability

### 2.1 When This Profile Is REQUIRED

A deployment MUST conform to this profile if any of the following conditions applies:

- The delegatee population includes or may include children (under the age of majority in the relevant jurisdiction)
- The delegatee population includes or may include adults under formal guardianship, conservatorship, or capacity-related legal arrangements
- The delegatee population includes or may include asylum seekers, refugees, or persons whose civil status is contested or fragile
- The delegation type itself reveals sensitive information about the delegator or delegatee (e.g., medical condition, immigration status, criminal proceeding involvement)
- The deployment is operating in a jurisdiction whose data protection regulator has determined that the underlying delegation context constitutes special-category data under GDPR Article 9 or equivalent

### 2.2 When This Profile Is RECOMMENDED

A deployment SHOULD conform to this profile if:

- The delegation occurs in a context where the delegator or delegatee has a reasonable expectation of contextual privacy beyond the immediate transaction (e.g., financial signing authority for a private trust)
- The deployment supports one-to-many delegations where cardinality could itself be sensitive
- The deployment crosses jurisdictional boundaries with non-uniform privacy regimes

### 2.3 When This Profile Is NOT REQUIRED

The base Reference Architecture is sufficient (and this profile is not required) when:

- The delegation is between professional peers in a single trust domain (e.g., physician-to-nurse within a hospital)
- The delegation is self-delegation by a competent adult to an agentic workload over their own affairs
- The delegation type and the parties' roles are public information by nature (e.g., publicly-disclosed corporate signing authority)

### 2.4 Conformance

A deployment claims conformance to this profile by:

1. Operating a regulated verification intermediary as defined in §3
2. Implementing all six privacy requirements R1–R6 as MUSTs (§4)
3. Issuing platform-facing credentials only through the two-token architecture defined in §5
4. Honoring the field constraints in §6
5. Producing audit records in the form specified in §8

Cryptographic unlinkability (§7) is an OPTIONAL extension; conformance to this profile does not require it, but deployments operating under heightened threat models SHOULD implement it.

### 2.5 Conformance Level Floor

Base spec §3.2 defines two independent axes: the **conformance level** (how a delegation is packaged) and the **deployment profile** (how much assurance its contents carry). This document is a profile on the second axis, and it sets a floor on the first.

**A conformant deployment operates at conformance level L2 (Distributed authorship).** The floor is structural rather than a policy preference: the verification intermediary (§3) is a distinct issuing role by construction — it holds the rich credentials, mints presentation tokens under its own key, and is regulated separately from the delegator and the relying party. A delegation whose Relationship, Authority, and presentation all issue from one party has no intermediary in it, and therefore has none of this profile's properties, whatever fields it carries.

Two consequences follow:

- **The compact (L0) packaging is not available under this profile.** A single self-issued `delegation+jwt` cannot express the intermediary's separate authorship, so a deployment MUST NOT claim conformance to this profile over one. Base spec §12.3.1 states the general form of the risk: accepting a level below the required floor is privilege escalation by repackaging, and a relying party operating under this profile MUST establish the required level from its own configuration rather than from the presented credential.
- **Role-scoped trust anchors (base spec §8.2, §12.2) are load-bearing here.** The relying party trusts the intermediary for presentation tokens; that trust does not extend to the underlying Relationship or Authority, which the relying party never sees and MUST NOT be asked to evaluate.

---

## 3. The Verification Intermediary Role

### 3.1 Definition

A **Verification Intermediary** is a regulated party that sits between the delegator/delegatee and the relying party (platform). The intermediary:

- Holds the rich base-specification credentials (Relationship, Authority, Task JWTs in their full form)
- Issues *presentation credentials* to relying parties on demand
- Maintains the authoritative audit trail of authorization events
- Manages revocation, transfer, and lifecycle events without leaking reasons to relying parties
- Operates under statutory confidentiality obligations equivalent to or stronger than those governing the underlying delegation context

The intermediary is the only architectural party that has access to the full delegation structure. Delegators and delegatees provide their authority instruments to the intermediary; relying parties receive only the flattened presentation. No other architectural party has visibility into both sides.

### 3.2 Regulatory Status

This profile does not specify the legal form of the intermediary's regulation; that is determined by the deployment's jurisdiction and use case. Examples of suitable regulatory frameworks include:

- **In the EU**: an entity authorized as a Qualified Trust Service Provider under eIDAS 2.0, with additional sectoral authorization for the delegation domain (e.g., authorization under national social-care law for child guardianship delegations)
- **In the UK**: an organization registered with the Information Commissioner's Office and additionally regulated by the relevant sectoral body (e.g., Ofsted for child welfare, the FCA for financial signing authority)
- **In the US**: a state-licensed entity operating under HIPAA-equivalent confidentiality obligations for healthcare contexts, or under state child welfare law for guardianship contexts
- **Cross-border**: an entity participating in a multilateral trust framework that imposes equivalent confidentiality obligations across the participating jurisdictions

The intermediary's regulatory status MUST be discoverable by relying parties, delegators, and delegatees through a published trust framework. The intermediary's authorizations MUST be bound to specific delegation domains; an intermediary licensed for child guardianship is not automatically authorized to handle financial signing authority.

### 3.3 Required Functions

A conforming intermediary MUST implement all of the following functions:

- **Credential intake** — accepts Relationship, Authority, and Task JWTs from authorized issuers; validates their conformance to the base specification; stores them with integrity protection
- **Presentation issuance** — derives presentation credentials per relying party request; ensures presentations conform to the field constraints in §6
- **Lifecycle management** — propagates revocation, transfer, and expiry events to active presentations; ensures the 24-hour enforcement window from §8.4 of the base specification is met
- **Audit trail maintenance** — records every presentation issuance event with cryptographic integrity, retains audit records for the period mandated by the deployment's regulatory framework
- **Authorized access** — provides the delegator, the delegatee (where appropriate to capacity), oversight bodies, and the data subject (where appropriate) with access to the audit trail in age-and-capacity-appropriate form
- **Regulator interface** — supports inspection by the deployment's regulatory authorities under defined access protocols

### 3.4 Prohibited Functions

A conforming intermediary MUST NOT:

- Disclose to relying parties any information about the underlying credentials beyond what the field constraints in §6 permit
- Use audit trail data for any commercial purpose, including profiling, marketing, advertising, or sale to third parties
- Correlate activity across relying parties for any purpose other than fulfilling its regulatory functions
- Hold relying-party-correlatable data in a form that could be subpoenaed without statutory protection (this MAY require segregating relying-party-specific data into per-relying-party encrypted partitions)
- Charge the data subject (the individual the delegation concerns, e.g., the child) for access to their own audit trail or for exercise of any right granted under applicable privacy law

### 3.5 Trust Establishment with Relying Parties

A relying party trusts an intermediary's presentation credentials by:

1. Validating that the intermediary is registered in a recognized trust framework for the relevant delegation domain
2. Validating the intermediary's signing key chains to a trust framework root
3. Caching trust framework state with bounded staleness to detect intermediary deauthorization

The base-specification's `iss` claim on the underlying credentials is *not* visible to the relying party; the relying party sees only the intermediary's `iss`. This is a deliberate consequence of R3 (role anonymization) — the underlying issuer's identity is itself a context-leak.

### 3.6 Placement of a Policy Decision Point

Base spec §11.7.1 raises the possibility that a deployment resolves governing instruments it was not handed — a standing constraint over the subject, an override held by a party outside the delegation chain — by retrieving them at decision time through a Policy Information Point attached to a Permissioned Capabilities PDP (base spec §11.1). Under this profile that retrieval is not an operational detail; it determines whether the profile's guarantees survive.

**The retrieval is a disclosure channel.** A query asking whether governing instruments exist for a subject discloses the subject's circumstances through its response, and through the **pattern of queries** even where each response is a bare boolean, because in the populations this profile protects the affirmative case is the minority. A relying party that observes such a lookup — or observes that one occurred at all — learns what R2 (§4.2) forbids it to learn. This is the same inference surface R1 (§4.1) addresses for cardinality, arriving through a different channel.

Accordingly, under this profile:

- A PDP that performs, or observes, decision-time retrieval of governing instruments for the subject **MUST reside within the intermediary's trust domain**. It MUST NOT reside within a relying party's trust domain, and a relying party MUST NOT be able to observe that such a retrieval occurred, its timing, or its outcome as distinct from the decision.
- Where a relying party's own PDP would otherwise need such an input, **the intermediary MUST perform the retrieval and the evaluation itself and convey only the decision** — the same resolution §6.9 applies to admitted-type gating and §6.2 applies to group membership.
- The intermediary MUST NOT reflect the existence, identity, issuer, or class of a retrieved instrument in a presentation token, in a decision response, or in any error or denial reason distinguishable from an ordinary refusal. A denial that discloses *why* the instrument denied is an R2 disclosure.
- An unreachable or unverifiable instrument source MUST fail closed (base spec §11.7.1), and the resulting refusal MUST be indistinguishable to the relying party from any other refusal.
- Because this profile relies on decision-time state, **"none — bounded by lifetime" is not an available status mechanism** for the sources involved (base spec §8.3.1; cf. §6.6).

**Consequence for the intermediary's role.** §3.3's required functions describe issuance, presentation, lifecycle, and audit — the intermediary as an issuing and flattening party. A deployment adopting this pattern makes it additionally a **decision-time actor**, evaluating with context the relying party may not hold and returning a decision rather than a credential. That is a larger operational and regulatory commitment than §3.2 contemplates, and a deployment taking it on should say so in its conformance statement (§2.4). It is not required by this profile; it is the condition under which the base specification's PIP-mediated direction can be adopted without breaking R2.


---

## 4. The Six Privacy Requirements (R1–R6)

These requirements are MUSTs for any deployment conforming to this profile. They apply to the credentials and metadata visible to relying parties; they do not apply to the rich credentials held inside the intermediary.

### 4.1 R1 — Cardinality Hiding

The presentation credential MUST NOT reveal how many distinct delegations a delegatee participates in, how many distinct delegators have authorized the delegatee, or how many distinct subjects (e.g., children) the delegator has authority for.

A care home manager authorized for sixteen children and a parent authorized for one child MUST produce presentation credentials that are structurally indistinguishable to the relying party. Cardinality is held internally by the intermediary; it does not appear in any field, header, signature, or pattern observable to the relying party.

This requirement is satisfied by the **intermediary-as-issuer pattern** (§3): all presentations are signed by the intermediary, so the relying party cannot link issuance volume to a specific delegator. Per-delegation issuance keys at the intermediary level MAY be used to further reduce correlatability.

For deployments operating under adversarial threat models (§7), cryptographic unlinkability extensions provide stronger cardinality hiding.

### 4.2 R2 — Legal-Basis Abstraction

The presentation credential MUST NOT reveal the legal basis under which the delegation was established. Specifically, the presentation MUST NOT contain or allow inference of:

- The category of underlying authority (foster care order, kinship arrangement, residential placement, court-appointed guardianship, special guardianship, voluntary care agreement, etc.)
- The specific instrument identifier (court order number, care plan reference, employment contract reference)
- The granting body (which court, which local authority, which corporate entity)

Where the underlying delegation requires distinguishing among legal bases for evaluation (e.g., a particular permission only applies under court-order-based authority), that distinction is made *inside the intermediary* during presentation derivation. The relying party receives only the resulting authorization decision, not the legal basis that led to it.

### 4.3 R3 — Role Anonymization

The presentation credential MUST NOT reveal the professional or institutional role of the delegatee. A presentation credential authorizing "this individual to manage this child's account" must not reveal whether the individual is a parent, foster carer, kinship carer, residential care manager, social worker, or court-appointed guardian.

Where the delegatee's role is *strictly required* for the relying party's authorization decision (e.g., a regulated medical procedure that only specific roles may authorize), the role is conveyed at a sufficiently abstract granularity that it does not identify the delegation type. "Authorized digital guardian" is acceptable; "residential care manager" is not.

The intermediary MAY issue different presentation credentials for different relying-party needs, with role abstraction tuned to each context. A medical platform receives "authorized clinical decision-maker"; a social media platform receives "authorized digital guardian." These are not the same credential, but neither reveals the delegatee's specific role.

### 4.4 R4 — Tier-Label Privacy

Where a deployment uses risk tiers (e.g., the high/highest assurance tiers in the base specification's profiles), the tier assignment MUST NOT correlate with the delegation type in a way that allows inference. Specifically:

- The highest assurance tier MUST be applicable to *any* delegation type that warrants it on independent risk grounds (account type, monetary value, age band, sensitivity of action) — not exclusively to delegations involving vulnerable populations.
- Tier labels MUST NOT use names or identifiers that themselves reveal context (e.g., a tier named "alternative-care-tier" violates R4; a tier named "high-assurance" does not).

This requirement follows from a structural observation: if the highest assurance tier is *only ever* applied to delegations involving children in care, then the mere fact of a presentation carrying that tier label is itself a leak. Tiers must be defined by intrinsic risk properties of the delegation, not by the delegatee population.

### 4.5 R5 — Audit-Trail Custody

The authoritative audit trail of authorization events MUST be held by the intermediary, not by relying parties. Relying parties MAY hold their own logs of presentations they have validated, but those logs MUST NOT be the system of record for the delegation's authorization history.

Specifically:

- The intermediary holds a complete record of every presentation issuance, including the underlying credentials referenced, the relying party served, the timestamp, and the audit identifier
- The relying party holds at most a record of the presentation it received and the authorization decision it made, sufficient for its own compliance purposes
- The intermediary's audit record is the artifact a regulator inspects when reviewing the delegation's history; the relying party's records are inspected only for the relying party's own conduct

This separation ensures that the intermediary's regulated confidentiality obligations apply to the most sensitive aspect of the delegation (its history) and that subpoenaing a relying party does not reveal the underlying delegation structure.

### 4.6 R6 — Purpose-Scoped, Unlinkable Credentials

A presentation credential issued for use with one relying party MUST NOT be presentable to a different relying party, and MUST NOT be cryptographically linkable to presentations issued for different relying parties.

The minimum implementation of R6 is **per-relying-party presentation issuance**: the intermediary issues a fresh presentation credential each time a relying party requires one, scoped (via audience claim, key binding, or both) to that specific relying party. A presentation issued for Platform A cannot be replayed at Platform B because Platform B's validation rules will reject it.

This minimum implementation satisfies R6 against passive observers but does not satisfy it against colluding relying parties: if Platform A and Platform B compare their presentations, they may observe identifiers (such as the delegatee's pseudonymous identifier) that allow correlation. Defending against colluding relying parties requires cryptographic unlinkability (§7), which is an optional extension to this profile.

For deployments where colluding relying parties are not a credible threat (e.g., heavily regulated platforms with strong contractual prohibitions on cross-platform data sharing), the minimum implementation is sufficient. For deployments where collusion is plausible (e.g., consumer-facing platforms operating under weaker enforcement regimes), the optional extension SHOULD be implemented.

---

## 5. The Two-Token Architecture

### 5.1 The Rich Token (Internal)

The rich token is the base-specification credential set: Relationship JWT, Authority JWT, Task JWT, and the Objective (base spec §9) whether carried as a standalone `objective+jwt` or inline in the Task, with full claims, full binding, and full identifiability. It is held by the intermediary and is not visible to relying parties.

The rich token continues to be the canonical artifact for:

- Audit trail evidence (an oversight body inspecting the delegation sees the rich token)
- Dispute resolution (a delegatee challenging an authorization decision can reference the rich token)
- Inter-intermediary handoff (when a delegation is transferred between intermediaries, the rich token travels)

### 5.2 The Presentation Token (Relying-Party-Facing)

The presentation token is a derived credential issued by the intermediary, scoped to a specific relying party and a specific authorization decision. It is the only artifact the relying party sees.

The presentation token's structure is:

```
{
  "iss": "<intermediary identifier>",
  "aud": "<relying party identifier>",
  "iat": <timestamp>,
  "exp": <timestamp>,
  "jti": "<unique presentation identifier>",
  "sub": "<pseudonymous subject identifier scoped to relying party>",
  "delegatee_pseudonym": "<pseudonymous delegatee identifier scoped to relying party>",
  "authorization": {
    "scope_class": "<abstract scope identifier from registered vocabulary>",
    "tier": "<assurance tier from base spec>",
    "valid_until": <timestamp>,
    "purpose": "<abstract purpose identifier>"
  },
  "audit_id": "<opaque audit correlation identifier>"
}
```

The presentation token is signed by the intermediary. Its `sub` and `delegatee_pseudonym` are pseudonymous identifiers that are unique to (this delegation, this relying party); the same delegation presented to a different relying party uses different pseudonyms.

The `authorization.purpose` member is an **abstract purpose identifier**, drawn from the base purpose-class vocabulary of base spec §9.4. It is a class label only: the Objective's structured `purpose` object — its `params` and `display` in particular — and the Objective's `action` and `beneficiary` are rich-credential material and never appear here (§6.8). Note that the purpose object relocated from Obligations to the Objective at base spec v2.5; a deployment implementing an earlier revision of this profile should re-check where it reads the value from.

### 5.3 What the Relying Party Cannot Determine

From the presentation token alone, the relying party cannot determine:

- The identity of the underlying delegator
- The legal basis of the delegation (R2)
- The professional or institutional role of the delegatee (R3)
- How many other delegations the delegatee participates in (R1)
- Whether this is a healthcare, child-welfare, or other sensitive delegation type
- Who the delegation's **beneficiary** is, or whether a beneficiary was named at all — the Objective never crosses the boundary (§6.8)
- The declared purpose beyond its abstract class: no `purpose.params`, no `purpose.display` free text (§6.8)
- Which RAR types the underlying Authority admits (§6.9)

The relying party can determine:

- That the delegation has been validated by a recognized intermediary
- The abstract scope class of the authorization (e.g., "platform account management")
- The assurance tier of the delegation
- The duration of the authorization

This is sufficient for the relying party to enforce its own access control rules without inferring the delegation context.

### 5.4 Issuance Flow

A presentation token is issued through the following flow:

1. The delegatee initiates an action at the relying party (e.g., setting up a parental control on a platform).
2. The relying party requests an authorization from the intermediary, naming the abstract action class and the audience identifier.
3. The intermediary validates the underlying rich credentials, evaluates the action against the rich credentials' obligations and constraints, and either issues a presentation token or denies the request.
4. The intermediary returns the presentation token to the relying party, either directly or via the delegatee acting as a pass-through.
5. The relying party validates the presentation token's signature against the intermediary's published keys, validates the audience binding, and proceeds with the action.
6. The intermediary records the issuance in its audit trail.

The relying party never speaks to the delegator's wallet, never sees the rich credentials, and never learns the delegation context.

---

## 6. Profile-Specific Field Constraints

These constraints apply to the platform-facing presentation token and to any other artifacts that may be visible to the relying party. They do not apply to the rich credentials inside the intermediary.

### 6.1 Scope Domain Abstraction

Under the base specification, `derivative_authority.permission.scope_domain` is a free-form URI. Under this profile, the scope domain visible to the relying party MUST be drawn from a registered abstract vocabulary.

The base abstract scope vocabulary includes:

- `urn:scope:guardianship:platform-account-management` — generic delegated authority over a subject's platform account
- `urn:scope:guardianship:data-processing-consent` — authority to grant or refuse data processing consent on behalf of a subject
- `urn:scope:guardianship:financial-decision` — authority over a subject's financial transactions and account configuration
- `urn:scope:guardianship:medical-decision` — authority over a subject's medical decisions
- `urn:scope:guardianship:platform-content-controls` — authority to configure content and contact restrictions for a subject

Profiles for specific deployment domains MAY register additional abstract scopes through a designated authority. Concrete deployment-specific URIs (e.g., `https://example-care-home.example/scope/foster-care-management`) MUST NOT appear in presentation tokens.

### 6.2 Group Descriptor Hiding

Where the underlying Relationship JWT contains a group descriptor (e.g., a policy-defined group of authorized key workers), the presentation token MUST NOT contain the group descriptor. The group is resolved inside the intermediary at presentation issuance time; the resulting presentation simply names a single pseudonymous delegatee. The relying party does not learn that the delegatee is a member of a group, nor the size or composition of the group.

### 6.3 Prior Authority Reference Hiding

The base specification's `prior_authority_ref` (Authority JWT, derivative_authority section) is part of the rich credential and MUST NOT appear in the presentation token. Chain depth and prior-authority structure are visible only to the intermediary.

### 6.4 Verified Claims Envelope Stripping

The base specification's `verified_claims` envelope (used for high-assurance Authority profiles) carries trust framework details, verification timestamps, and verification process identifiers. These MUST NOT appear in the presentation token; the assurance level is conveyed via the abstract `tier` field in the presentation.

### 6.5 Trigger-Based Expiry Opacification

Where a constraint in the rich credential carries a trigger-based expiry (base spec §7.7), the presentation token's `valid_until` MUST be a calendar timestamp, not an event reference. The intermediary computes a calendar expiry that bounds the trigger event with reasonable confidence (e.g., the next statutory review date, the child's next birthday) and re-issues a fresh presentation when the trigger event is approached or has occurred.

The relying party never sees the event type. A care home manager whose authority will end at the child's age of majority sees a presentation with `valid_until: 2027-04-15`; the platform does not learn that the date is the child's eighteenth birthday.

### 6.6 Revocation Status Opacification

Per base spec §8.4, revocation reasons are not transmitted to relying parties. Under this profile, the relying party MUST NOT receive any field that allows inference of the reason. A presentation that has been superseded due to a placement change and a presentation that has been superseded due to a planned handover are indistinguishable at the relying-party boundary.

**Declared status mechanism.** Base spec §8.3.1 makes the status mechanism a declared property of the deployment profile and offers a menu that includes "none — bounded by lifetime." **That option is not available under this profile.** The deployments in scope here are precisely the ones §8.3.1 excludes it for: a court order narrowing a guardianship, a placement ending, a safeguarding concern arising, an authority lapsing when a supervising body withdraws it. Each arrives between issuance and action, from a party other than the delegator, and its whole significance is that it must take effect before the next act.

A conformant deployment therefore declares a status mechanism that supports commit-time evaluation, and the **intermediary is the party that operates it**. This is the privacy-preserving property of the arrangement, not an incidental one: the relying party learns only that a presentation is or is not currently honored, on the intermediary's authority, and never queries a status source that would reveal the underlying delegation's identity, issuer, or change history. A relying party MUST NOT be given a status reference that resolves outside the intermediary.

### 6.7 Stage Schedule Hiding

Where the underlying Relationship uses Pattern B (single Relationship with stage-keyed eligibility, base spec §4.8), the presentation token MUST NOT contain the stage schedule. The intermediary evaluates the active stage at presentation issuance and emits a presentation reflecting only what is currently authorized.

**Terminology note (corrected for base spec v3.0).** An earlier revision of this section said the intermediary emits "the currently-active scope." That wording predates the removal of `scope_override` at base spec v3.0. Relationship-side stages now carry a descriptive `capacity_band` and never move scope; a graduated chain of scopes is carried on the Authority, either as a sequence of Authorities or as an Authority-side stage schedule whose bands name admitted RAR types (§5.5.1). The privacy requirement is unchanged and applies to both instruments: neither the Relationship's `capacity_band` schedule nor the Authority's stage schedule may appear in a presentation token, because either would disclose the subject's developmental or capacity trajectory — which for this profile's populations is among the most sensitive facts in the delegation. A presentation discloses the current position only, never the shape of the curve.

The reason this matters independently of the stage schedule: a relying party that observes a sequence of presentations over time can, in principle, infer the trajectory from the changes themselves. §7 (cryptographic unlinkability) is the mitigation where that threat is in scope; absent it, the intermediary SHOULD avoid presentation re-issuance patterns that correlate to stage boundaries.

### 6.8 Objective and Beneficiary Non-Disclosure

The **Objective** (base spec §9) was added to the base specification at v2.0, after this profile's first revision, and is the most disclosure-sensitive component in the model for the populations in scope here. It carries the umbrella `action`, the structured `purpose` object (`kind`, `params`, `display`), and an **optional `beneficiary`**.

**The Objective is rich-credential material.** A presentation token MUST NOT contain the Objective, whether it was issued as a standalone `objective+jwt` or inline in the Task. The only thing that crosses the boundary is the abstract purpose class in `authorization.purpose` (§5.2).

**The beneficiary MUST NOT reach a relying party in any form.** This is the strictest constraint in this profile, and it is worth stating why it is stricter than the surrounding ones. In the deployments this profile governs, the beneficiary is the protected person: the child, the adult lacking capacity, the person under a safeguarding arrangement. The rest of §6 hides *structure* — how many delegations exist, what legal basis underlies them, how deep the chain runs. The beneficiary field does not describe structure. It identifies the individual the entire arrangement exists to protect, and it does so in a component that is inert with respect to authority (§9.2), which means **disclosing it buys the relying party nothing it can act on.** A field that cannot affect an authorization decision and can identify a vulnerable person is pure disclosure risk.

Accordingly:

- A presentation token MUST NOT carry `beneficiary` in any encoding, including a pseudonym derived from it.
- Where the beneficiary and the delegation's subject are the same person, the presentation's `sub` pseudonym (§5.2) is the only permitted representation, and it remains scoped to (this delegation, this relying party).
- The Objective's `purpose.display` — human-readable text intended for a consent surface — MUST NOT be forwarded. Free text is the most common accidental disclosure path in practice, because it is written for a human reader inside the delegation and routinely names the protected person.
- The intermediary MUST evaluate the Objective internally where it is relevant to issuing a presentation, and MUST NOT delegate that evaluation to the relying party.

**Interaction with the inert property.** Base spec §9.2 forbids any verifier from using the Objective to derive, widen, or gate authority. That rule and this section compose cleanly: because no relying party may act on the Objective, withholding it removes no capability, and this profile loses nothing by making the withholding mandatory. The Objective's audit and consent value is preserved in full inside the intermediary, where §8's audit records retain it.

### 6.9 Admitted-Type Enumeration

Base spec v2.4 and v3.0 relocated the enforceable "within authority" test. `scope_domain` is now **advisory** (§5.5.1) and does not by itself gate an act; the enforceable test runs over an enumeration of admitted RFC 9396 RAR types, compared by registered-identifier equality. Base spec §5.5.1 leaves the wire carriage of that enumeration to a profile.

This has a direct consequence for §6.1. Abstracting `scope_domain` is now **cheap and no longer sufficient on its own**, because the abstracted value was never the enforceable one. Wherever a deployment carries an admitted-type enumeration — for a Permissioned Capabilities PDP evaluating an action before an Obligation is formed, for instance — that enumeration now carries the meaning §6.1 was written to protect.

Under this profile:

- An admitted-type enumeration MUST NOT appear in a presentation token. Type identifiers are registered and globally meaningful by construction, which is what makes them enforceable and equally what makes them disclosing.
- Where a relying party's PDP must gate by admitted type, the intermediary MUST perform the admission check itself and convey only the decision, in the same manner as §6.2 resolves group membership internally.
- Deployments registering abstract scope classes under §6.1 SHOULD also register the abstract-to-concrete type mapping with the same designated authority, so that the mapping is auditable without being disclosed at the boundary.

## 7. Cryptographic Unlinkability (Optional Extension)

### 7.1 When This Extension Applies

The minimum-implementation R6 (per-relying-party presentation issuance) is sufficient against passive observers but not against colluding relying parties. Deployments operating under threat models that include colluding relying parties — e.g., advertising-network platforms that exchange data, or platforms whose operators are subject to coercive demands by third parties — SHOULD implement this extension.

### 7.2 Approach: BBS+ or Equivalent Anonymous Credentials

Under this extension, the platform-facing presentation is not a JWT but an anonymous-credential presentation generated from a BBS+ signature (or equivalent unlinkable signature scheme such as CL-signatures or accumulator-based credentials).

The intermediary holds a long-lived BBS+ signing key. When a presentation is needed:

1. The intermediary derives a presentation that proves possession of a valid signature over a specified set of attributes, without revealing the underlying signature itself
2. The presentation is bound to the relying party's audience identifier through a fresh proof-of-possession
3. Two presentations issued for two different relying parties are cryptographically unlinkable: an observer comparing them cannot determine that they were derived from the same underlying signature

### 7.3 Trade-offs

This extension provides strong privacy guarantees but at significant operational cost:

- **Implementation complexity** — BBS+ libraries are less mature than vanilla JWT libraries; integration requires custom work at every relying party
- **Verification cost** — anonymous credential verification is computationally heavier than JWT signature verification
- **Standardization status** — BBS+ for VCs is being standardized at IETF and W3C; the specifications are still maturing as of 2026
- **Interoperability** — relying parties that don't support the underlying credential format cannot consume the presentation; deployments may need to support both formats during transition

For most deployments that need this profile, the minimum implementation (per-relying-party JWT presentations from a regulated intermediary) is operationally adequate; cryptographic unlinkability is reserved for deployments where the threat model genuinely requires it.

### 7.4 Hybrid Architectures

A hybrid architecture is permitted: the intermediary may issue JWT presentations for relying parties that do not support anonymous credentials, and BBS+ presentations for relying parties that do. The choice is made per relying party based on the threat model that relying party operates under.

## 8. Compliance and Audit

### 8.1 Required Audit Records

A conforming intermediary MUST maintain the following audit records for each delegation:

- A complete record of all rich credentials received from issuers, with cryptographic integrity protection
- A record of every presentation issuance, including:
  - The underlying rich credential identifiers
  - The audience (relying party)
  - The abstract scope and tier of the issued presentation
  - The timestamp
  - The opaque audit identifier returned to the relying party
- A record of every revocation, transfer, and lifecycle event affecting the delegation
- A record of every authorized access to the audit trail (who accessed it, when, what they viewed)

Audit records are retained for the period mandated by the deployment's regulatory framework. The retention period MUST NOT be shorter than the longest applicable statute of limitations for disputes arising from the delegation context.

### 8.2 Authorized Audit Trail Access

The audit trail is accessible to:

- The delegator (full visibility into delegations they have authorized)
- The delegatee (visibility into authorizations they have exercised)
- The data subject — i.e., the individual the delegation concerns, where distinct from the delegatee — in age-and-capacity-appropriate form, and in line with applicable privacy law (GDPR data subject rights, equivalent rights in other jurisdictions)
- Designated oversight bodies (e.g., Independent Reviewing Officers for child welfare, conservatorship monitors for adult guardianship, financial regulators for signing authority)
- The relevant regulator under defined inspection protocols
- Law enforcement under valid legal process, with notice to affected parties where permitted

The intermediary MUST NOT make audit trail data accessible to any other party, including the relying party that received the original presentation.

### 8.3 GDPR Article 25 Conformance Assertion

A deployment claiming conformance to this profile MAY assert conformance to GDPR Article 25 (data protection by design and by default) on the basis of the structural privacy guarantees provided by the profile. Specifically:

- R1–R6 collectively implement the data minimization principle (Article 5(1)(c))
- The two-token architecture implements purpose limitation (Article 5(1)(b))
- The intermediary's audit trail custody implements integrity and confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f))
- The pseudonymous identifiers and per-relying-party scoping implement pseudonymization as a safeguard (Article 25(1))

This assertion is not a substitute for a data protection impact assessment. Deployments processing special category data or operating at scale MUST conduct a DPIA per Article 35.

### 8.4 Data Subject Rights

The intermediary MUST support the following data subject rights for the individual the delegation concerns:

- **Right of access** — the data subject may request a complete view of the authorizations that have been exercised under delegations naming them
- **Right of rectification** — where a delegation contains inaccurate information about the data subject, the data subject may request correction
- **Right to erasure** — at the conclusion of the delegation (e.g., on reaching age of majority), the data subject may request deletion of audit records, subject to the regulatory retention requirements in §8.1
- **Right to portability** — the data subject may request export of the audit trail in a machine-readable form

These rights are exercised against the intermediary, not against the relying party. The relying party's own records (per §4.5) are subject to the relying party's own data protection obligations.

## 9. Worked Example: Care Home Manager → Platform

### 9.1 Setup

- A 12-year-old child is in residential care, under a court order assigning parental responsibility to the local authority.
- The local authority's care plan designates the residential care home manager as the Delegated Digital Authority Holder (DDAH) for the child's online activities.
- The child wishes to use a major social media platform.
- The platform requires verified parental consent under GDPR Article 8.

### 9.2 Rich Credentials (Inside the Intermediary)

The regulated verification intermediary (a child-welfare-authorized trust service operating under the framework of the local authority) holds:

**Relationship JWT** — type `legal-representative`, delegator is the local authority, delegatee is the care home manager (specifically, a role-tuple group requiring "registered care home manager + designated by current placement"), eligibility constrained by Pattern B graduated stage schedule keyed to the child's age, with stage transitions at 8, 13, 16, and 18.

**Authority JWT** — high-assurance profile with verified-claims envelope. Source authority asserts the local authority's parental responsibility under the court order (with concrete order number, court, and date — all visible only inside the intermediary). Derivative authority's scope domain is `urn:scope:guardianship:platform-account-management`, no further delegation permitted.

**Task JWT** — issued when the manager initiates the platform account setup. Single obligation of type `data_processing_consent`. Constraints include:
- Temporal: `valid_until` is calendar-bounded by the next statutory review date (six months out)
- Trigger-based: `expires_on_event: statutory_review_completed`
- Data-minimization: only specified GDPR Article 8 fields may be processed
- Conditional: only-if the child's age is within the current Care Plan's permitted band

### 9.3 What the Platform Sees

When the manager initiates the account setup, the intermediary issues the following presentation token to the platform:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://trust.example/intermediary/childcare-12",
  "aud": "https://platform.example",
  "iat": 1714000000,
  "exp": 1729800000,
  "jti": "urn:uuid:f9e8d7c6-5b4a-3210-9876-543210fedcba",
  "sub": "ps-7a3b9c1d2e4f",
  "delegatee_pseudonym": "dp-8b4c0d2e3f5a",
  "authorization": {
    "scope_class": "urn:scope:guardianship:data-processing-consent",
    "tier": "high-assurance",
    "valid_until": 1729800000,
    "purpose": "urn:purpose:platform-account-setup"
  },
  "audit_id": "ai-9c5d1e3f4a6b"
}
```

The platform validates this against the intermediary's published signing keys and proceeds with account setup.

### 9.4 What the Platform Does Not See

The platform does not learn:

- That the child is in residential care (R2 — legal basis abstraction)
- That the delegatee is a care home manager (R3 — role anonymization)
- That the manager is responsible for fifteen other children at the same home (R1 — cardinality hiding)
- The existence of the court order, its number, or the issuing court
- The Care Plan or its review schedule
- That the credential's actual expiry is bounded by a statutory review event (R6.5 — trigger-based expiry opacification)
- The graduated stage schedule that means the delegatee's authority will change as the child ages (R7 — stage schedule hiding)

A parent in a stable home setting up the same platform account for their own 12-year-old, and the care home manager setting up the account for the looked-after 12-year-old, produce structurally identical presentation tokens. The only differences would be in audience-bound pseudonyms and timestamps.

### 9.5 Lifecycle Events Without Leakage

Six months later, the child has been moved to a foster placement. The intermediary:

1. Receives notification from the local authority's case management system that the placement has changed
2. Revokes the underlying Relationship JWT (status: `revoked`, no successor reference because the new foster carer is a different DDAH; this is a hard transfer)
3. Issues a new Relationship JWT for the new foster carer
4. When the platform next checks the previous presentation token's audit id, the revocation status is `revoked` with no further detail
5. The new foster carer presents themselves at the platform, the platform initiates a fresh authorization, the intermediary issues a fresh presentation token

The platform observes only that "the previous credential is no longer valid; a new credential has been presented." It does not learn that this was a placement change. The platform cannot distinguish this case from other cases — a guardian who has decided to use a different device, a guardian whose credential has expired and been renewed, an emergency reassignment of authority. All look the same at the relying-party boundary.

## 10. Open Questions

### 10.1 Intermediary Discovery and Selection

This profile assumes that delegators and delegatees know which intermediary to use. In practice, intermediary selection may be non-trivial: a delegation may span jurisdictions, the underlying authoritative source may be operated by a different party than the deployment's intermediary, and trust-framework recognition across jurisdictions is itself a live topic. A subsequent revision should specify the discovery mechanism by which a delegator finds and authenticates the appropriate intermediary.

### 10.2 Inter-Intermediary Handoff

When a delegation is transferred between jurisdictions or trust frameworks, the rich credentials may need to move from one intermediary to another. The protocol for such handoff — preserving audit trail continuity, ensuring no party loses access to authoritative records — is left for future work.

### 10.3 Performance and Scale

The intermediary-as-issuer pattern adds an online dependency at the moment of authorization. For most current deployments this is operationally acceptable, but high-frequency authorization scenarios (e.g., continuous platform interactions) may warrant caching or pre-issuance patterns. Specifying these patterns without compromising R6 (unlinkability) is non-trivial.

### 10.4 Liability Allocation

A delegation may fail in ways that affect the data subject (e.g., a platform honors a presentation that should have been revoked). Liability allocation among the issuer of the underlying credentials, the intermediary, and the relying party needs to be addressed in the deployment's trust framework. This profile does not specify allocation rules; it provides the audit trail necessary to support such allocation under whatever regulatory framework applies.

### 10.5 Cross-Profile Interaction with the Base Specification

A deployment using this profile internally may receive credentials from a deployment using only the base specification (e.g., an agentic workload from another organization presenting a base-specification Task JWT). The rules for handling such cross-profile presentations — whether to upgrade them, refuse them, or treat them as a different trust class — are left to deployment configuration.

### 10.6 Cryptographic Unlinkability Profile

The optional cryptographic unlinkability extension (§7) is sketched but not fully specified in this draft. A subsequent revision should specify the BBS+ credential format, the key management requirements, the verification protocol, and the migration path from JWT to BBS+ presentations.
